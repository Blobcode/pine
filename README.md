## About <a name = "about"></a>

Pine is a simple rust-based reverse proxy built on top of hyper.
## Installing

To install, clone this git repo and `cd` into it

```
git clone https://github.com/blobcode/pine
```

```
cd pine
```

and run it using cargo.

```
cargo run
```

For best performance, run using the release flag enabled.

```
cargo run --release
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Pine relies on a configuration file named `config.ini` in the current working directory or one specified using `pine <path to config.ini>`. An example `config.ini` is provided below.

```
[config]
port = 3000
hosts = a, b

[a]
from = a.com, b.com
to = localhost:4000

[b]
from = c.com
to = localhost:5000
```

Here we can see the `[config]` header contains `port` and `hosts`. Port is the local port it will run on, and hosts is a list of the headers of all hosts you want served from the ones below.

Now let's take a look at `[a]` and `[b]`. They represent internal http services you want forwarded externally. In `[a]`'s case, it denotes that we should forward all requests looking for `a.com` or `b.com` to `localhost:4000`.

### Load Balancing
If you want to include load balancing, take a look at another project of mine, [scarf](https://github.com/blobcode/scarf), a super simple load balancer written in rust.
